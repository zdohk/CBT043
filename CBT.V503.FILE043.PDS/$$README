Congratulations - you have found CBTTape File043 - THE place to start.

================================================================================
OVERVIEW

This is an ISPF application that provides quick, and easy, access to the
contents of the CBTTAPE 'tape', updates, and overflow, directly from your
z/OS TSO/ISPF session.

This application requires that FILE001 be available. If it isn't, and FTP
is enabled, then it will be downloaded (see Dynamic download below). Then
the file will be processed to generate an index member (1-line description
for each CBT file), and a separate member for each CBT file with the full
file description/summary.

This is accomplished in one of two ways.

   - Bulk download
     * Download the ADRDSSU, FDR, or AWSTAPE, formats
     * This is for sites that do not have FTP access to the
       www.cbttape.org site

   - Dynamic download
     * Using this application, when a file is referenced that has not been
       downloaded, then it will be downloaded. If an update is available
       then the update will be downloaded
     * The download consists of:
       - downloading the zip file to the USS /tmp filesystem
       - unzip'ing the zip file
       - performing a binary upload of the resulting file
       - removing the zip file, and the unzip'd file, to clean up
       - performing a TSO RECEIVE if the unzip'd file is in TSO Transmit
         format
       - Updating the summary information about the file

The CBTTAPE is a collection of files (over 1,000 tools) for use with
z/OS.  These tools are all open-source and have been contributed to the
'tape' since 1975. Today the CBTTAPE is a website where all of the files
are available for access.  Its address is www.cbttape.org .

There are two 'tapes' in the CBTTAPE collection.

    - The current 'tape' that is accessed from the CBT link on the left
      of the webpage.
      - The updates page contains contributions to the 'tape' that
        arrived after the 'tape' was generated.
    - The overflow 'tape' is available via the Overflow link on the left
      of the webpage. These files are older and may not work with current
      versions of z/OS. They are included here for reference. See File 001
      on the Overflow site for details.

There is no set time, when a new "version" of the CBT Tape is cut.  When
a new version IS cut, then all the updates since the last version, are
merged into it, and a new "tape" is created.

When a new version of the CBT Tape is cut, it is as if a completely new
"tape" has been generated, with all the updated files merged in.

After that point, a new set of Updates is generated, to prepare for the
next "tape" version.

================================================================================
INSTALLATION
================================================================================

To Install this application copy the PDS into a new dataset with the
dataset name of hlq.FILEIDX.PDS. Where hlq is the high-level-qualifer
that will host all the CBTTape Datasets.

  Automated Installation and Update
  Execute the $INSTALL member of this PDS to:
     1. Prompt for a hlq.FILEIDX.PDS
        - ask for Replace or Update option
     2. If New or Replace then allocate the hlq.FILEIDX.PDS
     3. Copy the members from this PDS to FILEIDX.PDS
        - if Update then only key memebers
     4. If Update then exit the $INSTALL dialog
     5. Edit the CBTCONFG member
     6. Update the CBTVIEW member (exec) to reference the new
        hlq.FILEIDX.PDS dataset

  Manual Installation
  It is recommended that the PDS be a PDSE as it will be updated with one
  member for each CBT file and then periodically updated - with a PDSE you
  won't have to compress it.

      A recommended allocation is:
      RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=32720,SPACE=(TRK,(150,90,52))

Be SURE to edit the CBTCONFG member and review the site customization
settings. This is important if your site does not have the PDS and/or
the REVIEW commands. Also CRITICAL if your site does NOT allow FTP from
your z/OS system (change update to 0).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRE-REQUISITES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application has the following requirements:

   - Selection P requires the PDS command from FILE 182
   - Selection R requires the REVIEW command from FILE 182 or 134

   - FTP must be enabled to access the WWW.CBTTAPE.ORG site
     * may require opening your firewall if that is allowed

================================================================================
Installation Tasks
================================================================================

Download www.cbttape.org/ftp/cbt/CBT001.zip from the CBTTape web site.
unzip,  and upload in binary to a z/OS sequential dataset
(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80) named hlq.FILE001.DATA.

      NOTE:
      If this has not been done prior to starting this application
      then it will be attempted when this application starts, provided
      that FTP is allowed.

Then copy the CBTVIEW member to a dataset in your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC
library and update to reference the hlq.FILEIDX.PDS dataset. This will
be done automatically if using the $INSTALL exec.

Execute the CBTVIEW exec to setup the ALTLIB environment and then execute
the CBT exec in this library.  It will create the CBTINDEX member and then
display a table with a list of ALL of the CBTTape files.

Note:

After the dialog table is displayed, the DATE header field initially
contains the version number of the CBTTape. To the left of the DATE
field, there can be two indicators displayed.

   1. An "*" indicator will be displayed after the CBT file has
      been downloaded to your z/OS system and is available as a
      local dataset.
   2. A "+" sign will will be displayed if there is an update available
      for the CBT file on the website and the DATE field will contain
      the date of the updated file. After an update is downloaded, the
      summary file, hlq.FILEIDX.PDS(FILEnnnn), will be updated with the
      new @FILEnnn (or @FILnnnn) from the newly downloaded file.

================================================================================
USAGE
================================================================================

This application will display a selectable table of all CBT files with
the following options:

Commands:
    DS   (DS)    Display all the CBT datasets online
                 - DS
    Find (F)     Find a string in the description fields
                 - F str
    History (H)  Display a change history for the command
                 - H
    Info (I)     Display information about the CBT Application
                 - I
    Locate (L)   Locate a file number
                 - L 312
    New  (NE)    Limit the table to those files with an update date
                 - NE
    Only (O)     Limit the table to those records with the string
                 - O str
    Refresh (R)  Refresh the table (useful after using Only or Search)
                 - R
    REBuild (REB) Create or Recreate the CBTINDEX member
                 - REB
    ESearch (ES) Invoke CBTSRCH dialog from Willy Jensen for an
                 enhanced search experience.
    Search (S)   Use SuperC to search all of the file description
                 members and then limit the table to those files.
                 - when the individual file is then selected using
                   S or I then a find for the string will be done
                   (assumes that S is mapped to I).
    Site (SI)    Display only the files that have been downloaded and
                 are available on your local system
    Update (UPD) Check the CBTTAPE.ORG updates directory for updated
                 files since the date of the last update and then
                 download them, update the CBTINDEX and the FILEnnnn
                 members.
                 - Add any non-blank after the UPDate (e.g. UPD X) to
                   ignore the date of the last update check.
    CUrrent (CU) Work with the CBT production files *Default
    OVerflow (OV) Work with the CBT Overflow files
    /            - Display a popup menu

File Selections:
     S           Select the file and perform the default action
                 - default action is a setting in the CBT exec
     B           Browse the file
     C           Copy the dataset
     E           Edit the file
     I           Browse the file description member
     P           Open the file using the PDS command
     R           Open the file using the Review command
     U           Update the file with a fresh download
     V           Browse the file
     /           Display a popup selection menu

In the displayed table an * indicates that the file is available on the
local system. And a + indicates that there is an update available for
the file.

If a file has not been downloaded to your local system that the user is
prompted to allow this application to FTP the file from WWW.CBTTAPE.ORG,
unzip and then RECEIVE it into a dataset that can be accessed locally.
This will happen for all selections other than I.

When attempting to download a file, if an update exists then it will be
downloaded.

The FTP process utilizes the /tmp filesystem on your z/OS system for the
file work area. The FTP process is:

   1. Installs the unzip command from the FILEIDX.PDS(unzip) into /tmp
      for use after the zip file is downloaded from WWW.CBTTAPE.ORG.
      * this file is shipped in pax format and it automatically
      * extracted when copied to /tmp
   2. Creates a temporary file in /tmp with the FTP instructions
   3. Invokes the FTP OMVS command piping the temp file into FTP
   4. Unzip's the downloaded CBTnnnn.zip file.
   5. Performs an OGET of the resulting XMI or DATA file to z/OS
      in binary
   6. If the file was a XMI then perform a TSO RECEIVE
   7. Remove the files from /tmp except for unzip

================================================================================
NOTES

   1. If updates are enabled (update = 1 in CBTCONFG) then each time the
      dialog starts it verifies that FTP is available. If it isn't then
      it could take a minute or two to timeout at which point a message
      it generated and FTP is disabled for the session. If this happens
      verify that ftp to www.cbttape.org works and if it doesn't then
      change the CBTCONFG update setting to 0 until resolved.

   2. A check is made to verify that the pax extract of the unzip utility
      was successful. The only times it will fail is if the UNZIP member
      is corrupt - which can happen if the PDS was not transferred
      properly to allow the UNZIP to transfer in mode b and type e.

================================================================================

This PDS contains the file summary members for every PDS on the CBTTape along
with the following special members:

$$README   What you are reading.
$INSTALL   REXX Installation Dialog to allocate the hlq.FILEIDX.PDS
           and then copy the key members from this PDS to it
$INSTALP   ISPF Panel used by $INSTALL
CBT        The CBTTape ISPF Application - try it - you'll like it.
CBTCONFG   Site customization data for the CBT ISPF Application, and
           for CBTDOWN use.
CBTDOWN    Exec used by CBTDOWNJ (JCL) to download ALL, or a single file
           of the CBT files (File 001 is excluded as it should already be
           downloaded as it is used to create CBTINDEX).
           ** Uses the CBTCONFG for SYSOUT and VOLSER overrides
CBTDOWNJ   Sample JCL to run CBTDOWN.
CBTSRCH    Enhanced Search dialog by Willy Jensen
CBTSRCH$   Installation and use instructions for CBTSRCH
CBTVIEW    Copy this into a CLIST or EXEC library in your normal
           TSO library allocations and then tailor it to reference
           this PDS.
CBTINDEX   A one-line summary of every file on the CBTTape that is used
           by the CBT exec as an index. This is created by by the CBT exec.
           This member is a pre-req for the use of CBTDOWN
UNZIPXMI   This is a TSO Transmit of the OMVS port of unzip.  The
           $INSTALL will TSO Receive it into the target FILEIDX.PDS as
           UNZIP.  It is used when you request a CBT File that is not on
           your system under the same HLQ as this dataset.  Note: this
           member is in PAX format and will be copied and then extracted
           into /tmp when required.
UNZIPL     Unzip License
XMITINFO   Dave Alcock's tool from File 311 that reports information on
           the contents in a TSO Transmit dataset. Used by CBT to find
           RECFM and LRECL so that a more optimal BLKSIZE can be used
           during the RECEIVE process.
ZDATE      Created and updated with each UPDATE command. Initially does
           not exist.

If the CBTVIEW command is installed in a library in your CLIST or EXEC
allocation library then you can also add it to the ISPF command table
using these values:

    Verb:    CBT
    Trunc:   3
    Action:  Select cmd(%cbtview &zparm)
    Desc:    The CBT ISPF Application

================================================================================
Using CBTDOWN

CBTDOWN may be used to download all of the CBT Files, or just a single file.
Sample JCL is provided in CBTDOWNJ for processing all of the CBT files (as
you probably don't want to lock your ISPF session for this to complete).

The syntax is:

    To download all:   %cbtdown hlq
    To download 1:     %cbtdown hlq file
    To download 1 update:  %cbtdown hlq file U
