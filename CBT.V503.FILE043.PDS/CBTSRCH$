README for CBTSRCH

General information

 This is a companion program for CBT(VIEW).

 CBTSRCH focuses on the search-and display. It loads the CBT file 1
 into storage and creates 2 internal copies at every invocation, so it
 is rather heavy on resources when initializing.

 Highlights
 - Do an extended search of the the CBT file 1, using boolean AND or
   OR operators and even group comparators by paranthesis.
 - List the file description directly, use FIND and RFIND to scroll
   through the description(s).
 - Access the available CBT datasets (datasets which have been
   downloaded to your system) directly.
 - Download datasets from the CBT website to your system (requires
   that the CBT program is available).
 - Switch to the CBT(VIEW) program by Lionel B Dyck for enhanced file
   handling.

 Start the program and hit the HELP key to get an explanation of all
 the features.

CBTSRCH parameters

 Parameters are case insensitive.

 CBTHLQ(hlq)    required, no default.
 CBTSUF(suf)    default = 'DATA PDS'

 Explanation
  If the CBT datasets are named A.CBT.FILEnnnn.CNTL then hlq='A.CBT'
  and suf='CNTL'.
  If the CBT datasets are named A.CBT.FILEnnnn.CNTL and A.CBTnnnn.DATA
  then hlq='A.CBT' and suf='CNTL DATA'.
  Notes
  - the qualifier containing the CBT number must begin with 'FILE'.
  - the width of the number nnnn is determined by the program, but
    there must be a dot (.) immediately following the number in the
    actual datasetname.
  - CBT file 1 is expected to be named cbthlq.FILEnn1.DATA.


CBTSRCH sample call

 cc=CBTSRCH('cbthlq(a.cbt) suf(data cntl)')


INSTALL for CBTSRCH

Recommendations

 Do not modify CBTSRCH, rather create a driver REXX like this:

  cc=CbtSrch('cbthlq(A.CBT)')

  Use the ALTLIB command if CBTSRCH is not in the REXX/CLIST search
  concatenation.

  CBTSRCH should be installed into the same library as CBT(VIEW) by
  Lionel B Dyck, view the installation notes for CBT(VIEW) carefully.
